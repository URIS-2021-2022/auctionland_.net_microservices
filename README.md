 <h1>AuctionLand Microservices</h1>

<p>Welcome to the AuctionLand Microservices repository! This project is a group assignment completed for our college course, where we developed a .NET application with a microservice architecture.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
        <li>.NET Framework: The application is developed using the .NET Framework, providing a robust and reliable foundation.</li>
        <li>C#: The primary programming language used for implementing the application's backend logic.</li>
        <li>ASP .NET Web API: RESTful API endpoints are built using ASP .NET Web API to facilitate communication between microservices and the frontend.</li>
        <li>Microservices Architecture: The application follows a microservices architecture to achieve modularity and scalability.</li>
</ul>
